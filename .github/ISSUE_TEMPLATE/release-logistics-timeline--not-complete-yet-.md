## Before you set a timeline for expected release
It’s a courtesy to give a heads up about the release of a viz well before a release date is firmly set. They’ll need time to coordinate review/approval up the chain of command and might alert us to factors that could affect the final release timeline. 
- [ ] Communicate with Joe Nielsen and Jordan Read via email or chat about expected timeline for viz to be ready to review and approve.
- [ ] Complete IPDS review and approval process. Alert Joe and Jordan via email or chat when you complete each step so they know when they need to take action on anything. 
- [ ] Chat Jen Bruce / Web Comms to alert of upcoming release, discuss intended release timeline and avoid planning to release during weeks where other activities will drown out viz promo. 


## 2-3 Weeks Before Expected Release
- [ ] Post in Vizlab Teams Channel confirming IPDS Approval, state intended release timeline.
- [ ] Begin prepping social materials for Web Comms. See [ link ] for checklist of everything needed for them. Send link to the material to Jen Bruce when you're ready to start getting feeback. 
- [ ] Begin prepping a promotional packet to email to relevant parties so they have material to promote the release in their own way. 

## 1 Week Before Expected Release
- [ ] By COB Tuesday, send Social Media content to Jen Bruce in Web Comms for review.


## 2-3 Days Before Expected Release
- [ ] Send email to Joe Nielsen, Jim Galvin, Jordan Read confirming intended timeline of release.
- [ ] Expect back-and-forth on last minute changes to page and/or promotional content. 
- [ ] If possible, do a push to 'prod' without sharing the link so you can test the page.

## Day of Release!
- [ ] Confirm with Jen Bruce / Web Comms that post on @USGS_Water is live and is free of errors - that's the moment that we count the page as "Released."
- [ ] Send email to Joe Nielsen, Jim Galvin, Jordan Read confirming that page is live and has been successfully released on @USGS_Water.  Include links to the viz and @USGS_Water and @USGS_DataSci posts, and attach .zip folder of promotional materials. 
- [ ] Send email to project collaborators confirming that the page is live.  Include links to the viz and @USGS_Water and @USGS_DataSci posts, and attach .zip folder of promotional materials. 
- [ ] Expect feedback on typos, small changes, etc. to come in and be prepared to quickly address them. 

## 2-3 Days Post-Release
- [ ] Respond to emails and social media posts about the page.

## 1-2 Week Post-Release
- [ ] Check analytics and celebrate / discuss anything you find. 

## 3-4 Week Post-Release
- [ ] Hold a retro to discuss how the project went, what you learned, and how you can use those reflections to inform future projects.
